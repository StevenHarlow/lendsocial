    We receive data about you whenever you interact with LendSocial, such as when you look at another person's profile, send someone a message, search for a friend or a business, click on an ad, or add funds to your account.
    
    When you post things like photos or videos on LendSocial, we may receive additional related data (or metadata), such as the time, date, and place you took the photo or video.
    
    We receive data from the computer, mobile phone or other device you use to access LendSocial. This may include your IP address, location, the type of browser you use, or the pages you visit. For example, we may get your GPS location so we can tell you if any of your friends are nearby.

For example, an advertiser may tell us how you responded to an ad on LendSocial or on another site in order to measure the effectiveness of - and improve the quality of - those ads.
    
    We also put together data from the information we already have about you and your friends.

        to measure or understand the effectiveness of ads you and others see;
        to make suggestions to you and other users on LendSocial, such as: suggesting that another user add you as a friend because the user imported the same email address as you did, suggesting you check out a new business that is looking for a loan because you like those kinds of businesses, or suggesting that your friend tag you in a picture they have uploaded with you in it.
    
    
    Granting us this permission not only allows us to provide LendSocial as it exists today, but it also allows us to provide you with innovative features and services we develop in the future that use the information we receive about you in new ways.
    
    If you choose to apply for a loan or any of the benefits that result in sharing information about your business over the internet, you are agreeing to allow us to use your story in our promotion of LendSocial through our various media.
    
    We will work with you to make every attempt to protect your confidential non-public information and proprietary information and trade secrets from exposure through our advertising.
    
    Non-public information means information that the public is not able to see or acquire from your advertising, visiting your business or which has been published by you consciously or inadvertently on another website, publication or other source available to members of the general public.

        To other non-affiliated third parties as requested by you or your authorized representative, or when required or permitted by law.
    
    
    For example, we may disclose information in the context of an investigation of terrorism, money laundering, fraud prevention or investigation, risk management and security.
    
    Where you have a contractual relationship with a third party in connection with a product or service (such as through an insurance provider or another financing source when you are eligible for credit from a bank or investor), we may share information in accordance with such arrangement and the handling of information by that party will be subject to your agreement(s) with it.

        Do not respond to e-mails requesting account numbers, passwords or PINs for LendSocial website or database access or access to your online loan account. Call LendSocial to verify the legitimacy of the e-mail.
        Memorize PINs and refrain from writing PINs, Social Security numbers, debit or credit card numbers where they could be found.
        Shred documents containing any sensitive information before discarding, such as bank statements.
        Confirm that an Internet site is secure by checking that the URL (Web address) begins with “https”.

        If you think you have been a victim of identity theft or fraud, you may contact the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to report any incidents and to receive additional guidance on steps you can take to protect yourself. Contact the FTC at ftc.gov/idtheft or 1.877.438.4338.
    
    
    
    DEACTIVATING OR DELETING YOUR ACCOUNT
    
    If you want to stop using your account, you can either deactivate or delete it.
    Deactivate
    Deactivating your account puts your account on hold. Other users will no longer see your profile, but we do not delete any of your information. Deactivating an account is the same as you telling us not to delete any information because you might want to reactivate your account at some point in the future.
    
    You can deactivate your account on your account settings page.
    Deletion
    When you delete an account, it is permanently deleted from LendSocial. It typically takes about one month to delete an account, but some information may remain in backup copies and logs for up to 90 days. You should only delete your account if you are sure you never want to reactivate it.
    
    You can delete your account here.

    We may make changes to this policy at any time and will inform you of changes, as required by law. To receive the most up-to-date Privacy Policy, you can visit our Web site at: lendsocial.com/privacy.
