    3. Limitation of Liability
    
    4. Disputes with other Borrowers

    1. Participation in the Program
    
    LendSocial manages the Website, which matches you and other persons (each, a "Lender" and, collectively, "Lenders") with a business owner or owners in your or other communities (each, a "Borrower" and, collectively, "Borrowers") in need of affordable capital with added value. In most instances, these Borrowers are considered "high risk" by traditional lenders for a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the Borrowers' lower average credit scores, the use of the loan proceeds for entrepreneurial endeavors including investment in risky small businesses and in some select cases “start up” businesses, and the state of the economy in many regions. Please carefully review the Website section entitled "Risk and Due Diligence" which highlights the various risks associated with lending online through LendSocial and explains in greater detail the role played by LendSocial.
    By participating in the Program or otherwise accessing or using the Website, you hereby acknowledge and agree that (a) LendSocial makes no representation, warranty, covenant or guarantee that any funds you lend to a Borrower via the Website will be repaid in whole or in part, (b) loans and other similar transactions made via the Website (each, a "Loan") are unsecured and bear a high risk of non-repayment and (c) given your financial situation and objectives, you will lend only those amounts on the Website that you can afford to lose. Loans made via the Website are philanthropic in nature with no offered rate of return and, as such, are not intended as, and cannot be considered as, an investment in a financial instrument or security.
    
    1.1.    Loan Disbursement. You understand that your particular Loans are not made directly by you to the Borrowers and that LendSocial acts as an intermediary between you and the Borrower and will ultimately be the organization to issue the aggregated funding amount.  LendSocial takes sole responsibility in collecting the payments on this Loan.  At no point does issuing a Loan on the Website entitle you to partake in your own collection processes.  LendSocial may voluntarily choose to pre-fund your Borrower in the short-term from its own funds in anticipation of receiving your Loan amounts as backfill. This helps reduce the time the Borrower needs to wait until the Loan is funded on the Website. LendSocial serves as a middle-man in the Loan process and aggregates funds from multiple Lenders via the Website and disburses 100% of these funds on a net billing basis (excluding the interest earned, if any, on such funds while they are held in a LendSocial user loan funds account, which interest is contributed to fund LendSocial's operations) to the Borrowers selected by Lenders for funding on the Website.
    LendSocial is solely responsible for screening and selecting each Borrower (including, without limitation, approving the requests for Loans on the Website) and making all Loan disbursements.  Borrowers are screened through LendSocial’s proprietary credit scoring model and approved for listing if they surpass our qualifications.
    
    1.2    Loan Collection and Repayment. Loans are repaid directly by the Borrower(s) to LendSocial. As Borrowers repay the Loans, LendSocial will credit the accounts of all Lenders on the LendSocial website who have loans outstanding, regardless of whether they supported the particular Borrower successfully repaying. Repayments may be made in periodic installments, depending on the terms of the applicable Loan. These distributions may, in LendSocial's sole discretion, be made periodically or in one lump sum once 100% of all Loan proceeds for a particular Loan have been received by LendSocial. Furthermore, please note that timing of distributions to Lenders of any collected repayment may vary and may be materially impacted because of circumstances that, in LendSocial's judgment, require LendSocial to conduct further reviews with respect to the collected repayments (by way of one example, to resolve issues regarding accuracy of repayment amounts and corresponding data, or for other issues). If, for any reason, LendSocial is unable to collect Loan repayments directly from the Borrowers, repayment of your Loan amounts could be at risk of partial or total delay or non-repayment and a loss of some or all of your principal could occur. While it is the business policy of LendSocial to return 100% of your principal to you over time, you hereby acknowledge and agree that the Borrower(s) will have no direct contractual obligation or liability to pay you any principal and that LendSocial is obligated to repay only such Loan principal to the extent actually received by LendSocial from the Borrowers (subject to the conditions noted above). Neither LendSocial or any Borrower will have any obligation to pay interest on the Loan or other fees or amounts (other than as expressly set forth above) to you. You should note that LendSocial charges an interest to the borrowers on the Loans posted on the Website in order to provide default protection to all our Lenders and cover our expenses.
    
    1.3    Tax Deductibility. You understand that LendSocial is a not a non-profit public benefit corporation. You acknowledge, that because you are making a Loan and not donating any money, you are not eligible to receive a tax deduction. You also understand that you are solely responsible for determining the proper tax treatment for any Loan you make through the Website and the Program. LendSocial has not and will not provide any tax or legal advice to you in connection with any Loan you might make. This Agreement does not attempt to define the tax implications of participating in the Program. If you participate in the Program, you should consult with your own accountants, tax advisors and legal advisors.
    
    1.4.    Loan Records. Records of each Loan you make are kept by LendSocial, displayed on your account in the Website (when we come out of Beta), and upon your written request, will be made available to you at any time throughout the term of the Loan. The amount of funds you have available in your LendSocial account that is available to be lent can be accessed via your online account created upon registering at the Website.
    
    1.5    Principal Loss Scenarios. LendSocial will generally deem a Loan to be in default if LendSocial determines that collection of funds from a Borrower for such Loan is doubtful or a repayment on the Loan is six (6) months past the originally scheduled repayment date (for any expected repayment, including interim repayments), although case by case differences may exist based on pending prospects for repayment of the Loan. In cases where a Loan is in default, and subject to the distribution timing provisions noted in Section 1.2 (Loan Collection and Repayment) above, LendSocial will use the interest payments on other Borrowers’ Loans to repay the remaining principal owed to you.  If a large amount of Loans are in default or poor standing and LendSocial is unable to pay back the principal on your Loan, you understand and hereby consent (without any prior notice thereof) to any restructuring of the repayment plan for your Loan and/or, in LendSocial's sole discretion, any extension of the length of the term of your Loan in order to increase the chances that your Loan is repaid or that amounts of your Loan are repaid.
    
    If for any reason less than 100% of your Loan is repaid, you agree that LendSocial and any Borrower shall have no liability therefor, and you hereby release and forever hold harmless LendSocial and any Borrower for any loss you may incur. You should consult with your accountant and/or tax advisors to determine the appropriate tax treatment of such a loss.
    
    1.6    Insufficient Lender Funds. In the event that you make a Loan and your payment does not clear (e.g., an eCheck does not validly deliver to LendSocial the full amount of the intended Loan, or your payment provider reverses a payment originally intended for LendSocial), you agree that LendSocial may, in its sole discretion, (i) offset the amount of the insufficiently funded Loan against your account balance or (ii) withdraw and cancel your insufficiently-funded Loan from your account as not paid in full.
    
    1.7    Auto-lending; "Pick a Loan" Feature (In construction). Without in any way limiting the earlier provisions of this Section 1, LendSocial may implement Website features pursuant to which a User may – in lieu of manually accessing his or her registered account to specify a Loan or Loans to make – establish account settings to automatically make Loans based on the User's prior instructions and without further direct input from the User, based on User-selected preferences, the amount of available balance in the User's account, and other business factors, such as the availability of Loans on the Website and other parameters as may be determined by LendSocial in its sole discretion. To the extent a User chooses to activate the auto-lending feature on the User's registered account, and depending on the particular preferences selected by the User, any and all available balance at any time in such User's account (including, but not limited to, repayments on previously made Loans or new available balance otherwise deposited into the User's account) may be subject to being automatically deployed under the auto-lending program. You understand and acknowledge, however, that a User's activation of the auto-lending choice on such User's account does not necessarily guarantee that Loans will be successfully made. Variables such as a User's particular set of auto-lending preferences, or the general availability of Loans not already funded through manual selection by other LendSocial’s Users, or other feature parameters as established by LendSocial in its sole discretion, may impact the chances of an automatic Loan being made. You further acknowledge and agree that any Loans transacted under the auto-lending feature are in all respects Loans voluntarily made by you as the User, based on your instructions as reflected in your preference settings simply executed by the LendSocial system and subject to overall availability of Loans and other feature parameters, and are under no circumstances to be considered to be Loans chosen by LendSocial on such User's behalf. Furthermore, in no event will a Loan made pursuant to the auto-lending feature, by a User who has chosen to activate the auto-lending feature, be cancellable or refundable by the User. You agree that LendSocial and any Borrower shall have no liability if for any reason less than 100% of a Loan made pursuant to auto-lending is repaid, and you hereby release and forever hold harmless LendSocial and any Borrower for any loss you may incur from an auto-lending Loan. LendSocial may modify or terminate the auto-lending functionality at any time or from time to time.
    
    Without in any way limiting the earlier provisions of this Section 1, LendSocial may implement Website features pursuant to which a User may ask to have the Website randomly suggest a particular Loan for the User to consider making. To the extent a User employs this 'pick a loan' suggestion feature, you understand and acknowledge that you have an opportunity to learn more about that Loan before deciding whether or not to fund such Loan and that you have complete discretion to decline to fund such Loan. You further acknowledge and agree that any Loans transacted under the 'pick a loan' suggestion feature are in all respects Loans voluntarily made by you as the User. You agree that LendSocial and any Borrower shall have no liability if for any reason less than 100% of a Loan made pursuant to the 'pick a loan' feature is repaid, and you hereby release and forever hold harmless LendSocial and any Borrower for any loss you may incur from a Loan suggested by the 'pick a loan' feature. LendSocial may modify or terminate the 'pick a loan' suggestion functionality at any time or from time to time.
    
    1.8    User Account Inactivity; Instructions for Auto-Donation of Funds to LendSocial or Auto-Withdrawal Return of Funds to User; Potential Escheatment of Funds.
    
    LendSocial welcomes its Users' active participation in the LendSocial Program. However, there may be occasions when a User becomes "inactive" for an extended period of time – i.e., a User does not log in to his or her LendSocial account or there are no credits/withdrawals made to such User's account. Therefore, LendSocial may implement Website features pursuant to which you may instruct LendSocial in advance as to how you wish any remaining balances in your account to be handled in the event your account were to become inactive for a period of 24 or more consecutive months -- namely, whether in such a case of User inactivity, you (i) wish to automatically donate remaining funds in your account to be continuously lent out to Borrowers in LendSocial's Program or (ii) wish for LendSocial to return remaining funds in your account to you via LendSocial's standard account withdrawal process.  In addition, in such cases of User inactivity, LendSocial may elect to automatically terminate the inactive User account.  You will upon registration on the Website automatically be opted-in to instructing LendSocial to auto-convert any remaining account balances as a donation to be continuously lent out to Borrowers using LendSocial's Platform if your account were to become inactive for a period of 24 or more consecutive months. Please note that you are free to change this pre-set option in your discretion and at any time in advance (although you understand any funds that have been auto-donated based on the then-existing preference setting shall not be revocable once the auto-donation has taken place).
    
    In the event that your account shows no activity for an extended period of time and (i) you have not indicated an instruction to LendSocial through an inactivity preference selection described above or (ii) your instructions to have remaining balances returned to you cannot be successfully completed, whether due to invalid/incomplete information, your failure to claim the funds after thirty (30) calendar days have passed from the day LendSocial has forwarded the funds to you, a return of funds back to LendSocial as unclaimed after LendSocial has attempted to forward your funds to you, or for any other reason internal or external to LendSocial, then LendSocial may determine it is appropriate to forward (i.e., escheat) the balance remaining in your inactive LendSocial account to the state government of your state of residency. In such a case, LendSocial will determine your residency based on the state listed in your mailing address information that may have previously been made available to us. If your address is unknown or is outside of the USA, LendSocial may then find it is appropriate to forward (escheat) your funds to the State of California. If your funds are escheated to a state authority, you would have to contact the relevant state's unclaimed property administrator to reclaim such funds.
    
    1.11    LendSocial API (In construction).  The LendSocial API is a service that LendSocial provides to allow third parties to develop and offer applications, services and features using information from the Website and Program (“Third Party Applications”).  Third Party Applications are not created or maintained by LendSocial but by third parties.  These third parties’ terms of service and privacy policies govern your use of Third Party Applications.  Any authorization you give to any third party or Third Party Application to take actions on your behalf does not relieve you of any of your responsibilities under this Agreement.  LendSocial gives no guarantees or warranties with respect to any Third Party Application and is not responsible for your use or inability to use any Third Party Application, including without limitation the content, accuracy, reliability or security of Third Party Applications or the privacy practices or other policies of third parties.  To revoke permissions that you have granted to a Third Party Application, you may revoke these permissions by logging into your account on the Website or by contacting LendSocial.

    3. Limitation of Liability
    
    You understand that any and all decisions made by you with respect to the Website and Program are yours alone. LendSocial cannot and does not verify the accuracy of information from other Users or Borrowers. LendSocial shall not be responsible, or have any duty or obligation to, or liability for: (a) decisions or interactions resulting (directly or indirectly) from participation in the Program; or (b) any damages, costs, losses or expenses a User incurs as a result (directly or indirectly) of making a Loan to a Borrower or as a result (directly or indirectly) of utilizing the Program or information received in connection with the Program. In addition, in no event will LendSocial be liable to you or any third person for any damages, costs, losses or expenses, including any lost capital, lost profits or special, incidental, consequential or punitive damages arising from your use of the Website or participation in the Program, even if LendSocial has been advised of the possibility of such damages, costs, losses or expenses.
    
    4. Disputes with other Borrowers
    
    LendSocial is not responsible for your interactions with any other User or any Borrower (even to the extent prohibited by this Agreement) and any disputes or damages that may result from such interactions.
    
    LendSocial reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor disputes between you and such persons.
    
    5. Governing Law; Resolution of Disputes; Arbitration and Waivers
    
    This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its choice of law or conflict of law provisions. If any dispute arises between you and LendSocial, including, without limitation, any dispute arising from or relating to the Website or the Program, you agree that all such disputes will be determined exclusively by final and binding arbitration, in accordance with the then existing commercial rules of the American Arbitration Association in San Francisco if the amount claimed is greater than $100 and otherwise over the telephone or in another city in which LendSocial is located. The arbitration shall be heard and adjudicated by one arbitrator to be selected by you and LendSocial. Any award will be final, binding and conclusive upon the parties, subject only to judicial review provided by California statute, and a judgment rendered on the arbitration award can be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or LendSocial may seek any injunctive relief in a state or federal court in San Francisco, California, as may be necessary to preserve rights pending the completion of arbitration and LendSocial may seek any injunctive relief in a state or federal court in San Francisco, California, or another court of competent jurisdiction, at any time against any violations of Section 2 (Proprietary Rights) or Section 3 (Acceptable Use) of this Agreement.
    
    TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, BY AGREEING TO SUBMIT ALL DISPUTES TO BINDING ARBITRATION, YOU AND LendSocial HEREBY WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY OR COURT TRIAL OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR BASED UPON THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY CONTEMPLATED USE HEREIN, INCLUDING CONTRACT, TORT, BREACH OF DUTY AND ALL OTHER CLAIMS, EXCEPT AS SPECIFICALLY PROVIDED ABOVE.
    
    You waive, to the maximum extent not prohibited by law, any right you may have to claim or recover, in any legal action or proceeding, any special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages.
    
    6. Indemnity
    
    You agree to indemnify and hold LendSocial harmless from any loss, liability, claim, or demand, including reasonable attorney's fees, made or incurred by any third party due to or arising (directly or indirectly) out of your use of the Website or participation in the Program or arising from your breach of this Agreement.
    
    7. Term; Termination
    
    This Agreement will remain in full force and effect while you access or use the Website or participate in the Program as a User and, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this Agreement will remain in effect after your participation in the Program and registered account is terminated. From time to time, LendSocial may make features available to Users as part of the Program. LendSocial reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to include or cease providing these features at any time. Whether or not you are and remain eligible to participate in the Program, use the Website or any LendSocial services, may be determined by LendSocial in its sole and absolute discretion. You may terminate your participation in the Program and registered account at any time and for any reason by sending a written notice of termination to LendSocial along with instructions for the disposition of your then-available balance and any additional balance that you may receive in the future (e.g., based on repayments of then-outstanding and active Loans), such notice to be effective within three (3) days of receipt by LendSocial. LendSocial may also terminate your participation in the Program and registered account at any time and for any reason, effective upon transmission of notice to you at the email address you provide to LendSocial. Upon such a LendSocial-initiated termination, your available balance shall be returned to you within thirty (30) days of account termination and any available balance you may receive in the future shall also be returned to you in due course.
