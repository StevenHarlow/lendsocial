    By using the LendSocial Website, you agree to the following terms of Acceptable Use:
    
    Privacy
    
    Your privacy is very important to us. We designed our Privacy Policy to make important disclosures about how you can use LendSocial to share with others and how we collect and can use your content and information.  We encourage you to read the Privacy Policy, and to use it to help make informed decisions.
    Sharing Your Content and Information
    
    You own all of the content and information you post on LendSocial, and you can control how it is shared through your privacy and application settings. In addition:
    
        For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos (IP content), you specifically give us the following permission, subject to your privacy and application settings: you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you post on or in connection with LendSocial (IP License). This IP License ends when you delete your IP content or your account unless your content has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it.
        When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer. However, you understand that removed content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time (but will not be available to others).
        When you publish content or information using the Public setting, it means that you are allowing everyone, including people off of LendSocial, to access and use that information, and to associate it with you (i.e., your name and profile picture).
        We always appreciate your feedback or other suggestions about LendSocial, but you understand that we may use them without any obligation to compensate you for them (just as you have no obligation to offer them).
    
    Safety
    
    We do our best to keep LendSocial safe, but we cannot guarantee it. We need your help to do that, which includes the following commitments:
    
        You will not send or otherwise post unauthorized commercial communications (such as spam) on LendSocial.
        You will not collect users' content or information, or otherwise access LendSocial, using automated means (such as harvesting bots, robots, spiders, or scrapers) without our permission.
        You will not engage in unlawful multi-level marketing, such as a pyramid scheme, on LendSocial.
        You will not upload viruses or other malicious code.
        You will not solicit login information or access an account belonging to someone else.
        You will not bully, intimidate, or harass any user.
        You will not post content that: is hateful, threatening, or pornographic; incites violence; or contains nudity or graphic or gratuitous violence.
        You will follow our Promotions Guidelines and all applicable laws if you publicize or offer any contest, giveaway, or sweepstakes (“promotion”) on LendSocial.
        You will not use LendSocial to do anything unlawful, misleading, malicious, or discriminatory.
        You will not do anything that could disable, overburden, or impair the proper working of LendSocial, such as a denial of service attack.
        You will not facilitate or encourage any violations of this Statement.
    
    Registration and Account Security
    
    LendSocial users provide their real names and information, and we need your help to keep it that way. Here are some commitments you make to us relating to registering and maintaining the security of your account:
    
        You will not provide any false personal information on LendSocial, or create an account for anyone other than yourself without permission.
        You will not create more than one personal profile.
        If we disable your account, you will not create another one without our permission.
        You will not use LendSocial if you are under 13.
        You will not use LendSocial if you are a convicted sex offender.
        You will keep your contact information accurate and up-to-date.
        You will not share your password, (or in the case of developers, your secret key), let anyone else access your account, or do anything else that might jeopardize the security of your account.
        You will not transfer your account (including any page or application you administer) to anyone without first getting our written permission.
        If you select a username for your account we reserve the right to remove or reclaim it if we believe appropriate (such as when a trademark owner complains about a username that does not closely relate to a user's actual name).
    
    Protecting Other People's Rights
    
    We respect other people's rights, and expect you to do the same.
    
        You will not post content or take any action on LendSocial that infringes or violates someone else's rights or otherwise violates the law.
        We can remove any content or information you post on LendSocial if we believe that it violates this Statement.
        If we remove your content for infringing someone else's copyright, and you believe we removed it by mistake, we will provide you with an opportunity to appeal.
        If you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights, we will disable your account when appropriate.
        You will not use our copyrights or trademarks (including LendSocial, the LendSocial Logos), or any confusingly similar marks, without our written permission.
        If you collect information from users, you will: obtain their consent, make it clear you (and not LendSocial) are the one collecting their information, and post a privacy policy explaining what information you collect and how you will use it.
        You will not post anyone's identification documents or sensitive financial information on LendSocial.
        You will not tag users or send email invitations to non-users without their consent.
    
    You acknowledge, consent and agree that LendSocial may, at its sole discretion and to the extent permitted by law, access, read, preserve and disclose your account information, usage history and User Generated Content in order to: (a) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; (b) respond to claims that any Content violates the rights of third parties, including without limitation intellectual property rights; (c) enforce this Agreement and investigate potential violations thereof; (d) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues; (e) respond to your requests for customer service; or (f) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of LendSocial, its users, or the public. Please see the Privacy Policy for more information regarding the use and disclosure of your information as part of the Program.

    Third Party Sites

    The Website contains (or you may be sent through the Website) links to other web sites ("Third Party Sites"), as well as content, information, images, photographs, pictures and materials (including, without limitation, text, graphics, designs, music, sound, video, information and software) belonging to or originating from third parties ("Third Party Content"). Such Third Party Sites and Third Party Content are not investigated, monitored or checked for accuracy, appropriateness, or completeness by LendSocial, and LendSocial is not responsible for any Third Party Sites accessed through the Website or any Third Party Content posted, uploaded, transmitted or otherwise shared on the Website, including without limitation the content, accuracy, offensiveness, opinions, reliability or policies of or contained in the Third Party Sites or the Third Party Content. Inclusion of or linking to any Third Party Site or any Third Party Content does not imply approval or endorsement thereof by LendSocial. If you decide to leave the Website and access a Third Party Site, you do so at your own risk and you should be aware that our terms and policies no longer govern. You should review the applicable terms and policies, including privacy and data gathering practices, of any site to which you navigate from the Website.
    
    Promotions

    If you use LendSocial to communicate about or administer a promotion (such as a contest or sweepstakes), you are responsible for the lawful operation of that promotion, including the official rules, offer terms and eligibility requirements (e.g., age and residency restrictions), and compliance with regulations governing the promotion and all prizes offered in connection with the promotion (e.g., registration and obtaining necessary regulatory approvals). Please note that compliance with these guidelines does not constitute the lawfulness of a promotion. Promotions are subject to many regulations and if you are not certain that your promotion complies with applicable law, please consult with an expert.
    
    Promotions on LendSocial must include the following:
    
            A complete release of LendSocial by each entrant or participant.
            Acknowledgment that the promotion is in no way sponsored, endorsed or administered by, or associated with, LendSocial.
            Disclosure that the participant is providing information to [disclose recipient(s) of information] and not to LendSocial.
            You must not condition registration or entry upon the user taking any action using any LendSocial features or functionality. For example, you must not condition registration or entry upon the user liking a Wall post, or commenting or uploading a photo on a Wall.
            You must not use LendSocial features or functionality as a promotion’s registration or entry mechanism. For example, the act of liking a Page cannot automatically register or enter a promotion participant.
            You must not use LendSocial features or functionality, such as the Like button, as a voting mechanism for a promotion.
            You must not notify winners through LendSocial, such as through LendSocial messages, chat, or posts on profiles.
            Definitions:
    
    a. By “administration” we mean the operation of any element of the promotion, such as collecting entries, conducting a drawing, judging entries, or notifying winners.
    
    b. By “communication” we mean promoting, advertising or referencing a promotion in any way on LendSocial, e.g., in ads, on a Page, or in a Wall post.
    About Advertisements and Other Commercial Content Served or Enhanced by LendSocial
    Our goal is to deliver ads that are not only valuable to advertisers, but also valuable to you. In order to do that, you agree to the following:
    
        You can use your privacy settings to limit how your name and profile picture may be associated with commercial, sponsored, or related content (such as a brand you like) served or enhanced by us. You give us permission to use your name and profile picture in connection with that content, subject to the limits you place.
        We do not give your content or information to advertisers without your consent.
        You understand that we may not always identify paid services and communications as such.
    
    Special Provisions Applicable to Advertisers
    
        You can target your specific audience by buying ads on LendSocial or our publisher network. The following additional terms apply to you if you place an order through our online advertising portal (Order):
            When you place an Order, you will tell us the type of advertising you want to buy, the amount you want to spend, and your bid. If we accept your Order, we will deliver your ads as inventory becomes available. When serving your ad, we do our best to deliver the ads to the audience you specify, although we cannot guarantee in every instance that your ad will reach its intended target.
            In instances where we believe doing so will enhance the effectiveness of your advertising campaign, we may broaden the targeting criteria you specify.
            You will pay for your Orders in accordance with our Payments Terms. The amount you owe will be calculated based on our tracking mechanisms.
            Your ads will comply with our Advertising Guidelines.
            We will determine the size, placement, and positioning of your ads.
            We do not guarantee the activity that your ads will receive, such as the number of clicks you will get.
            We cannot control how people interact with your ads, and are not responsible for click fraud or other improper actions that affect the cost of running ads.
            You can cancel your Order at any time through our online portal, but it may take up to 24 hours before the ad stops running.  You are responsible for paying for those ads.
            Our license to run your ad will end when we have completed your Order. You understand, however, that if users have interacted with your ad, your ad may remain until the users delete it.
            We can use your ads and related content and information for marketing or promotional purposes.
            You will not issue any press release or make public statements about your relationship with LendSocial without written permission.
            We may reject or remove any ad for any reason.
            If you are placing ads on someone else's behalf, we need to make sure you have permission to place those ads, including the following:
                You warrant that you have the legal authority to bind the advertiser to this Statement.
                You agree that if the advertiser you represent violates this Statement, we may hold you responsible for that violation.
